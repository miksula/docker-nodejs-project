## Getting Started

To run the app.js with Docker container separately:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t node-app .
   ```

   ```bash
   docker run -it -p 4001:4001 node-app
   ```

To run this project with Docker Compose:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

2. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

3. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:4001`.

To build and run the project with on command:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Configuration

### Node.js App

The Node.js app is located in the `src` directory. You can modify the application logic in the `app.js` file and define additional routes in the `routes/index.js` file.

### Caddy Proxy

The Caddy server acts as a proxy for the Node.js app. The configuration file `Caddyfile` defines the proxy settings and server configurations. You can modify this file to customize the behavior.

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services, networks, and volumes for the application. It includes separate services for the Node.js app and Caddy. You can modify this file to add additional services or customize the existing ones.

### Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` is used to build the Docker image for the Node.js app. It specifies the base image, copies the necessary files, and installs dependencies. You can modify this file if needed.
